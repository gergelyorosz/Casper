# Casper with Comments and Rich Description Field

A fork from the default theme for [Ghost](http://github.com/tryghost/ghost/).

Modifications:
- Disqus comments added
- The blog's description can contain HTML elements and the HTML formatting will be used (as per [this](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/issues/1517) workaround)
